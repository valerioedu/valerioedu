### Hi there 👋

My name is Valerio and I'm a second year student at the Polytechnic of Milan - Information Engineering. 
In my spare time I enjoy working on low level projects and studying physics, avionics and aerodynamics for motorsport🏎️

## What are you going to find on my profile?

I'm going to share all of my major projects, especially low level C programs, however you will find also higher level projects, like C# applications or go programs.
