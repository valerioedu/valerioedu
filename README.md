### Hi there üëã

My name is Valerio and I'm a first year student in both Polytechnic of Milan - Aerospace Engineering and University of Pisa - Computer Science. 
In my spare time I enjoy working on low level projects and studying physics and aerodynamics for motorsportüèéÔ∏è

## What are you going to find on my profile?

I'm going to share all of my major projects, especially low level C programs, however you will find also higher level projects, like C# applications, go servers or python programs
